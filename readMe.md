# mmFoodCA (mmfood.ca)

- This is a simple website made for a small business in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.
- The static files have not been uploaded as of yet. I'm unsure on copyright issues.
- The template was bought from ![themeForest](https://themeforest.net/item/zoon-coming-soon-template/31097749) 
and I installed and configured it.
- The stack is a very simple `FastAPI` app for the business logic, uvicorn for the server logic, 
hosted on a $5 Vultr server with 4 uvicorn workers.
- Please let me know if there are any questions!
